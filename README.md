Hi, I’m Cady!
I am interested in all things data and all things visual.
I'm currently learning Matplotlib and a bunch of other Data Science tools.
I'd love to collaborate with someone, I'm big on social issues, nerd things, and anything image related.
If you'd like to reach me, my twitter handle is @Cady_Codes. Eventually I'll get an email, promise.
